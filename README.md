Many organizations use Microsoft Planner for team collaboration, but Planner’s native reporting is limited. This BI report solves that by enabling:

Real‑time task monitoring
Parent–child hierarchical structures (up to 6 levels)
Project‑wise progress tracking
Assignments per user
Calendar & Gantt‑style visualizations
Task-On-Time vs Late vs Completed analysis

# All visuals dynamically filter based on the projects the user is assigned to.
